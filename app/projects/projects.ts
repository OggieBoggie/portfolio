        description: "This project was sponsored by PlaceSpeak, a company that created a platform aimed at enhancing local citizen engagement and is planning to expand further into the United States. The project builds upon the existing platform, placespeak.com, by creating modular components and extending the neighborhood mapping to the U.S. Our solution sought to increase user engagement by encouraging interactions through gamification elements such as a points system and unlockable badges. Additional features developed include profile customization and the distribution of polls to users within the same neighborhood. The front end was developed with React, Next.js, Tailwind CSS, and TypeScript. The back end utilized Django with PostgreSQL and PostGIS, employing shapefiles to delineate neighborhood boundaries. WebSockets were implemented for real-time updates on polls, enabling users to receive instant notifications. OAuth was incorporated to facilitate account creation and login using Google. This project was executed using Agile and Scrum methodologies over a period of four months by an eight-member team.",

Gym members have access to a randomly selected workout routine, and they can also select their workouts with specific filters to check whether specific equipment is available at certain gyms or not. Gym members can also track and document their progress using the tables and calendar view page. Users can view which gyms have which equipment and the contact details, so they can plan accordingly. Gym managers can add and manage their gyms, specifying what equipment is available and its condition. This app was created using Node.js and Express for the backend, with Passport authentication, and EJS for the frontend. Unit tests were also used with CircleCI for continuous integration. This project was created using Agile methodologies and Scrum for project management over a 4-week period and with a team of 5.",
