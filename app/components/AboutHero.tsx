                Hello my name is Tommy Nguyen, I was born in Vancouver, but 
                I am Vietnamese. I am able to fluently speak English and 
                am currently studying at BCIT in Computer Information 
                Technology. Growing up, I have always been interested in
                computers and technology, as I have always been fascinated
                with what they can do. I am eager to learn more about 
                developing applications their architecture, so I aspire
                to become a full-stack developer or cloud engineer.
